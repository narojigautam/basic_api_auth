# BasicApiAuth
A basic SHA1 hashkey based authentication implementation.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'basic_api_auth'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install basic_api_auth

## Usage

Create a config/basic_api_auth_key.yml file with an authentication key as follows:

    api_key: 'API-KEY-HERE'

## Generation of Hashkey

The hashkey sent to the api call should be generated by following these steps :

1. Order all the parameters of the cal in alphabetic order of its keys
2. Convert them into a string representation such that, if the hash is of type {name: 'snarf'} then its string representation would be "name=snarf"
3. Append the api key given to you to the string after adding a "&" so the resulting string will become "name=snarf&API-KEY-HERE"
4. Use SHA1 to generate a hashkey from the resulting string
5. Append the generated hashkey as a paramter of the API call
